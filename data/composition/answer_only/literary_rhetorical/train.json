Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. \n\nFor reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:\n**syntactic ambiguity**: A situation where a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure. For example, \"John saw the man on the mountain with a telescope.\" The syntax is ambiguous as it could either mean that John used a telescope to see the man on the mountain, or that the man on the mountain had a telescope and John saw the man.\n**diversion**: A tactic where the arguer diverts attention away from the relevant conclusion. For example, The prosecutor claims without proof the defendant is guilty of child abuse. The prosecutor then goes on and on about how awful child abuse is, instead of proving the original claim of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\n\nPlease start the minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:'.\n\nThanks very much!", "input": "", "output": "Answer: \"Upon spotting the elf with the stolen ring, the dwarf, swift to divert, bragged about his legendary battles.\"<|endoftext|>"}, {"instruction": "Greetings!

Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. \n\nFor reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:\n**syntactic ambiguity**: A situation where a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure. For example, \"John saw the man on the mountain with a telescope.\" The syntax is ambiguous as it could either mean that John used a telescope to see the man on the mountain, or that the man on the mountain had a telescope and John saw the man.\n**post hoc ergo propter hoc**: A fallacy of the form \u201cafter this, therefore because of this\u201d. For example, \"'Why are you whistling?' 'To keep the elephants away.' 'But there are no elephants around here.' 'See?
